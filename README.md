# SUPlate
An HTML template set that uses the [Stanford University identity toolkit](http://identity.stanford.edu/) and the [Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) to create Stanford-themed pages.

Integrates the Stanford brand bar and typical Stanford elements (colored boxes and the Stanford logo) to make theming sites easy. Designed to be a basic example of how to theme Stanford pages effectively.

##Major features:

* Instant branded site name (just change the text in the H1 element)
* Stanford brand header with new "SUNet Login" link integrated
* Stanford brand footer
* Fully compatible with Bootstrap framework
* Mobile/tablet compatible (thanks to Bootstrap)
* Depends on Stanford's su-identity package, which is hosted externally; 

## Install
Requires [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) to be installed in the assets/bootstrap directory. Just view pages after that!

## Guarantees
I made this one lazy night for future projects. Markup not guaranteed XHTML compliant or anything. No warrantees.

## Corrections welcome
Feel free to correct the templates or add features and submit a pull request.

## License
To the maximum extent possible, I license this project under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). Note the the project includes content/code from the Stanford identity people. That code had no attached license, so I presume it's fine to use if you are making things in a Stanford-compliant way.

Note that the project does NOT distribute any Stanford wordmarks or other trademarked material, beyond the word "Stanford" occasionally, which I argue is fair. All Stanford images, brandbar styles, etc. is hotlinked from stanford.edu and remains under the control of Stanford University.
